= Exercise 1.2 - Backing up Configurations

---

****
Now that you've gotten a sense of how ansible works, we are going to write our first
ansible *playbook*.  The playbook is where you can take some of those ad-hoc commands you just ran
and put them into a repeatable set of *plays* and *tasks*.

A playbook can have multiple plays and a play
can have one or multiple tasks.  The goal of a *play* is to map a group of hosts.  The goal of a *task* is to implement modules against those hosts.

For our first playbook, we are only create a backup of our two routers.

Section 1 - Creating a Directory Structure and Files for your Playbook

There is a link:{dir_url}[best practice] on the preferred directory structures for playbooks.  We strongly encourage
you to read and understand these practices as you develop your Ansible ninja skills.  That said,
our playbook today is very basic and creating a complex structure will just confuse things.

Instead, we are going to use a pre-defined directory structure for our playbook, and add playbooks to it.

====
*Step 1:* Navigate to the networking-workshop directory
----
 cd ~/networking-workshop
----
*Step 2:* Understand your inventory.  Inventories are crucial to Ansible as they define remote nodes on which you wish to run
your playbook(s).  Cat out (or vim into) your inventory file to understand the hosts file we'll be working with.

----
cat lab_inventory/hosts
----
You'll notice that we are working with 3 groups.  The control group, which is the node that we are currently ssh'd into.
The routers group, which is a grouping of two routers (R1 and R2). And finally the hosts group, which has another linux node residing in a separate VPC.
====

[.lead]
Section 2 - Defining Your Play

Let's create our first playbook and name it ```backup.yml```.
----
vim backup.yml
----
Now that we are editing ```backup.yml```, let's begin by defining the play and then understanding what each line accomplishes


====
[source,bash]
----
---
- hosts: routers
  name: backup router configurations
  gather_facts: no
----

====

- ```---``` Defines the beginning of YAML
- ```hosts: routers``` Defines the host group in your inventory on which this play will run against
- ```name: backup router configurations``` This describes our play
- ```gather_facts: no``` Tells Ansible to not run something called the ```setup``` module.
The setup module is useful when targeting computing nodes (Linux, Windows), but not really used when targeting networking devices.
We would use the necessary platform_facts module depending on type of nodes we're targeting.

[.lead]
Section 3: Adding Tasks to Your Play

Now that we've defined your play, let's add the necessary tasks to backup our routers.  Align (vertically) the *t* in ```tasks``` with the *g* ```gather_facts```.  +
Yes, it does actually matter.  In fact, you should make sure all of your playbook statements are aligned in the way shown here. +
If you want to see the entire playbook for reference, skip to the end of Section 4 of this exercise.

====
[source,bash]
----
tasks:
  - name: grab running configuration
    ios_command:
      commands:
        - show run
    register: config

  - name: save output to backups directory
    copy:
      content: "{{config.stdout[0]}}"
      dest: "backups/show_run_{{inventory_hostname}}.txt"
----

====

- ```tasks:``` This denotes that one or more tasks are about to be defined
- ```- name:``` Each task should be given a name which will print to standard output when you run your playbook.
Therefore, give your tasks a name that is short, sweet, and to the point

---

[source,text]
----
ios_command:
  commands:
    - show run
register: config
----
- These four lines are calling the Ansible module *ios_command* and then passing in commands to the routers.
link:{ios_command_url}[Click here] to see all options for the ios_command module.
We are also registering the output of the show run command to a variable that we will be using to generate the backup file.

---

[source,text]
----
copy:
  content: "{{config.stdout[0]}}"
  dest: "backups/show_run_{{inventory_hostname}}.txt"
----
- The next few lines are using the *copy* ansible module to copy a file to a destination.  link:{copy_url}[Click here] to learn more
about the *copy* module.  We are taking the content of the variable we registered in the previous task and copying it into the backups directory.

---

Section 4: Review

Now that you've completed writing your playbook, it would be a shame not to keep it.

Use the ```write/quit``` method in ```vim``` to save your playbook, i.e. ```hit Esc then :wq!```


And that should do it.  You should now have a fully written playbook called ```backup.yml```.
You are ready to automate!

[NOTE]
Ansible (well, YAML really) can be a bit particular about formatting especially around indentation/spacing.  When you all get back to the office,
read up on this link:{yaml_url}[YAML Syntax] a bit more and it will save you some headaches later.  In the meantime, your completed playbook should look
like this.  Take note of the spacing and alignment.

[.lead]
Section 5: Running your playbook

We are now going to run your brand spankin' new playbook on your two routers.  To do this,
 you are going to use the ```ansible-playbook``` command.

====
*Step 1:* From your playbook directory ( ```~/networking-workshop``` ), run your playbook.
----
ansible-playbook backup.yml
----
====
[NOTE]
- *--syntax-check* If you run into any issues with your playbook running properly;
you know, from that copy/pasting that you didn't do because we said "_don't do that_"; you could use this option to help find those issues like so...
----
ansible-playbook backup.yml --syntax-check
----

OK, go ahead and run your playbook as specified in *Step 1*

In standard output, you should see something that looks very similar to the following:

image::stdout_1.png[caption="Figure 1: ", title="backup playbook stdout"]

Notice that the play and each task is named so that you can see what is being done and to which router it is being done to.
