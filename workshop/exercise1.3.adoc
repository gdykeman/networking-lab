= Exercise 1.3 - Creating a GRE Tunnel

---

****
*Let's work on our next playbook, creating a GRE Tunnel between rtr1 & rtr2*

Before we go into creating the playbook, let's look at what we're trying to accomplish. +
- We have two VPC's, *VPC 1 & VPC 2 with rtr1 and rtr2* residing in each VPC respectively +
- We are going to *bridge the two VPC's via a GRE Tunnel* between rtr1 and rtr2 +
- We'll use the *GigabitEthernet1* interface on both routers to configure the tunnel
====
*Step 1:* Make sure you're in the networking-workshop directory +
----
cd ~/networking-workshop
----

====
*Step 2:* Let's create our playbook named gre.yml +
----
vim gre.yml
----
====
====
*Step 3:* Setting up your playbook +
In this playbook, we'll be running two plays, one for each router. +
Let's start with router 1. +
Note that the "hosts:" is targeting *rtr1*
[source,bash]
----
---
- hosts: student(X)-rtr1.net-ws.redhatgov.io
  name: create GRE Tunnel on R1
  gather_facts: no
----
====
====
*Step 4:* Adding the tasks for R1 +
[source,bash]
----
  tasks:
    - name: create tunnel interface to R2
      ios_config:
        lines:
         - ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
         - tunnel source GigabitEthernet1
         - tunnel destination <IP of Router 2>
      parents: interface Tunnel 0
====
====
*Step 5:* Setting up the play for R2 +
Note that the "hosts:" is targeting *rtr2*
[source,bash]
----
- hosts: student(X)-rtr2.net-ws.redhatgov.io
  name: create GRE Tunnel on R2
  gather_facts: no
----
====
====
*Step 6:* Adding the tasks for R2 +
[source,bash]
----
  tasks:
    - name: create tunnel interface to R2
      ios_config:
        lines:
         - ip address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.0
         - tunnel source GigabitEthernet1
         - tunnel destination <IP of Router 1>
      parents: interface Tunnel 0

====
Now that you've completed writing your playbook, let's go ahead and save it.

Use the ```write/quit``` method in ```vim``` to save your playbook, i.e. ```hit Esc then :wq!```

We now have our second playbook.  Let's go ahead and run that awesomeness!
====
====
*Step 7:* Running the playbook +
From your networking-workshop directory, run the gre.yml playbook
----
ansible-playbook gre.yml
----
====

[NOTE]
====
- You've successfully created a playbook that targets both routers in sequential order. Woohoo!
- The GRE Tunnel should be configured.  Feel free to log into any of the routers and ping the other endpoint of the tunnel
