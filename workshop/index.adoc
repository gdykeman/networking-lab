Overview

Today is meant for anyone who has any exposure to Ansible, whether you have used it or not. The format of this discussion is a
combination of presentation, demonstration, and hands-on labs.

[.lead]
Your Responsibilities

* Have a discussion. This will be boring if it's just us up here talking the entire time.
* Participate. We are going to cut you loose with Ansible here in just a little while. Have questions. Have opinions.

Hopefully you have your laptop with you. If not, please find a shoulder-surfing buddy.

and part of that experience is typing out YAML and understanding it's syntax, spacing, and alignments.
